TODO: Add ability to breed pets

TODO: Add ability to purchace pets from the games store (important)

TODO: Add maturity of pets. Required for several of the games functions

TODO: Add competition. Still thinking of a wat to impliment this feature for now. Feel free to provide any suggestions.

NOTE FROM LIAM R: I have finished many of the ticked functions without updating github. This is because If i break the game I do not wish for it to effect anyone elses code.
It will be properly uploaded after some more testing.
